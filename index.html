				Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) contain bioactive components with functional properties that may modify cardiovascular risk. The aims of this pilot study were to evaluate the ability of black beans to attenuate postprandial metabolic, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses and determine relative contribution of dietary fiber and antioxidant capacity of beans to the overall effect. In this randomized, controlled, crossover trial, 12 adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS) consumed one of three meals (black bean (BB), fiber matched (FM), and antioxidant capacity matched (AM)) on three occasions that included blood collection before (fasting) and five hours postprandially.

			<section class="right blue title">Cheese</section>
			<p class="clear text">
				Cheese serves as a one of the good sources for essential nutrients, such as proteins, lipids, minerals and vitamins. It can enhance health benefits by the production of certain peptides and free amino acids which has various bioactive properties, such as anti-microbial, anti-carcinogenic, anti-thrombotic and so on. Certain biologically active lipids, such as conjugated fatty acid (CLA) and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), present in cheeses are also found to be health beneficial. Thus, it plays a very important role in the diet of human; however, it suffers from adverse nutritional image due to the presence of saturated fatty acid, cholesterol and salt content.
